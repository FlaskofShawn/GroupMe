## Project Summary

GroupMe helps students connect their class groups by sending the WeChat QR code and Discord link to their email. The app contains the following four views: login view; profile view; course search view; course info view. They can search the courses by scanning the schedule builder with the camera or typing the course name in the search bar. After adding the courses, they will see a list of the added courses on the dashboard which they can expand for more details. They will also receive an email that contains the WeChat QR code and Discord link of their added courses. The front-end are mostly completed with a smooth flow in the app. We used the OCR technology to scan a picture and extract the keyword using string pattern matching. We then search our database to return the specific query. All group links are pre-created manually in the database, but we plan to apply web-scraping and APIs to load class information into the database and create group links automatically after the quarter.

Check the group schedule details at [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/upsiiTAh/ecs-189e-project)
