# Sprint Planning 2

**Members:** 

Weiyi Zhou, Draco Chen, Zhihao Zhang, Xiangyu Li, Yunlin Huang

## Project Summary

GroupMe is designed for college students to find online groups and post reviews for their classes. This app contains the following six views: LoginView; MainDashBoardView; CourseSearchingView; CourseInfoView; WriteReviewView; and UserProfileView. We will provide a sketch by Balsamiq to display the layout of our view controllers. In the coding part, the front-end team will complete the UI designs and navigation flow for our views, and the back-end team will continue researching the implementation of database for our app. After simplifying the workload on the server side discussed with professor and the TAs, the whole team will discover alternative features that enrich the performance of our app.

    Friday
- Communicate with other members to decide the next step for the Milestone 1
- Reconsider the weight of web and server work and the contribubtion of iOS side
- Implement the view controllers of those 6 screens and wire them up

   based on the iOS side
- Decide the way of transitions between different views
