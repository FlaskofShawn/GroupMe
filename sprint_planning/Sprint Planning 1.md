# Sprint Planning 1

**Members:** 

Weiyi Zhou, Draco Chen, Zhihao Zhang, Xiangyu Li, Yunlin Huang

## Project Summary

GroupMe is designed for college students to find online groups and post reviews for their classes. We have decided the following six views: LoginView; MainDashBoardView; CourseSearchingView; CourseInfoView; WriteReviewView; and UserProfileView. We also designed the component layout for each view with sketch. The next step is to initialize the UI design with minimalist style. The front-end team will write programmatic code to achieve the functionality of UI components. Meanwhile, the back-end team will research about the API usage, open source packet and how to access the course schedule data from UC Davis website.
