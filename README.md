# GroupMe - Find your class group

**Installation tips**: Before you run the program, change your bundle id to your individual choice, e.g. ta_bundle_id. For your first run, you might need to wait to install the database and indexing in the background about 8 to 10 minutes.

**Before you scan:** We manually inputted the course info in our database. Before you scan your schedule builder or a list of class names, please use the following classes, otherwise, the app won't return class not in the database. We support [ECS 150, ECS 153, ASA 002, ECS 162, ECS 152A, ECS 188, ECS 132, MAT 108, PHI 005, PHI 031].

### Project Summary

GroupMe connects users to their class groups by sending the WeChat QR code and Discord link to their email. This app contains the following five views: login view; sign up view; profile view; course search view; course info view. Users will be promoted to login with their email and/ or password. They can search the courses by scanning their schedule builder with the camera or typing the course name in the search bar. They can click on the course cell to review the course information in a pop-up view. Once they add the selected courses, they can refresh the schedule in their profile to review a list of added courses and expand the course cell for more information. The app will email the users with the WeChat QR codes and Discord links of their added courses. The user can then open their email and join the class groups from their preferred social media.

For more information, please review the documentation in the sprint planning folder.
